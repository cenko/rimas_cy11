RIMAS is a new NIR instrument designed expressly to identify high-redshift 
$\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) from \textit{Swift} within minutes, scheduled to be installed on the 
4.3\,m Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) in the first half of 2015. RIMAS can operate in and switch 
rapidly (10s of seconds) between three modes: 1) simultaneous 2-band imaging; 2) high-throughput, $R \approx 25$ 
NIR spectroscopy; 3) high-resolution ($R \approx 4500$), cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy providing 
simultaneous coverage from 0.9--2.4\,$\mu$m. Unlike other large aperture facilities that 
are classically scheduled, RIMAS will be continuously available for automated ToO observations. 
Additionally, the instrument's pick-off dichroic beamsplitter will allow simultaneous coverage with a visible imager, 
the Large Monolithic Imager (LMI). By the end of cycle 11, we intend for RIMAS to be routinely 
obtaining rapid multi-color photometry and NIR spectra of \textit{Swift} afterglows to measure 
their redshifts and constrain properties of their host galaxies and the surrounding 
IGM.
